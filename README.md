While compiling this fork with Visual Studio 2013, compilation of caffe-bin fails with the following error:

    error MSB8020: The build tools for v120 (Platform Toolset = 'v120') cannot be found. To build using the v120 build tools, please install v120 build tools.  Alternatively, you may upgrade to the current Visual Studio tools by selecting the Project menu or right-click the solution, and then selecting "Upgrade Solution...".	C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V120\Microsoft.Cpp.Platform.targets	64	5	caffe-bin

Unfortunately, there are no "Issues", so I'm posting this here.
